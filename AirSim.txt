Setup Unreal and Visual Studio for AirSim

1. Install Unreal Engine 4.27 (install epic games launcher, put account, download Engine), open it and "fix now"

2. Download AirSim prebuildt source code and the environment that you want

3. Place the Environment in AirSim/Unreal/Environment

4.0 Install Visual Studio 2019 + C++ dev / Python

4.1 https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/build_windows/
Use Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt with Admin priv to run AirSim-1.7.0-windows/build.cmd

5. https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_blocks/
Install .net framework 4.6.2 Developer (SDK), desktop runtime 3.1.24 (asks for it anyways)
Run AirSim-1.7.0-windows/Unreal/Environments/Blocks/update_from_git.bat

6. Open .sln with Visual Studio 2022 (or 2019 if the only installed), set Blocks as default Project, DebugGame Editor & Win64, press F5

7. Once Unreal is open with the project, click "Play" and use keyboard to move wtc



Python Interface with AirSim

0. Take AirSim-1.7.0-windows/PythonClient/multirotor/hello_drone.py

1. Delete first line of import

2. Create Anaconda env: advdl_env

2.1. pip install numpy, opencv-python, msgpack-rpc-python, airsim (https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis/)

3. Install Visual Studio & recommended python extensions

4. Unreal might lag if there is another window on top: Edit->Editor preferences->search Performance->disable "Use less CPU when in background"



Drone settings

0. Setup the settings.json in the working folder in Documenti/AirSim

1. Decide whether to use simpleflight or PX4 (https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/px4_setup/)



Tips

The async functions overwrite previous calls (u can use the output from the NN setting an arbitrary duration)
After 1 second without api calls, the drone goes in hovering mode
